  <!-- Philosophy -->
  <section class="philosophy">
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that <strong>decentralization is the future</strong> of trust,
      ownership, and collaboration. Crypto is more than just digital money;
      it’s a revolution in how we share value, create transparency, and
      build communities without borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mission is to <strong>simplify crypto for everyone</strong> —
      whether you’re an investor, developer, or complete beginner. I see blockchain
      not as a speculative asset, but as a technology that can solve real-world problems,
      empower people, and promote financial freedom globally.
